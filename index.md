## A brief bio

I am a responsible, self-reliant and hardworking individual who is passionate about changing the environment around me for the better. I love learning new things and challenging conventions. I am a critical thinker and a solutionist. I enjoy solving complex problems and my strong analytical background assists me in doing so. I have a business orientated mind-set and I think practically when solving problems. I love working with people, as well as leading them. I believe an optimistic mind set is key for any organisation to flourish and I encourage this through my own example in the teams I work with.

### Career goals

I want to become a fully qualified actuary in the near future and Iâ€™m currently writing the last couple of actuarial exams. I want to work with people to provide innovative digital solutions to problems.
